# Workspace Settings

The **Workspace Settings** panel lets you personalize how you interact with Sandworm. Whether you're running queries on different chains, using your own RPC endpoints, or just want to vibe in dark mode — this is where you configure it all.

---

### 🌐 Default Chain Selection

You can set your **default chain** so every new query or session starts on your preferred network.

- Available options include Sui, Eth, Base, Optimism and any other supported chains.
- This chain will be auto-selected in:

  - The query editor
  - Dataset explorer
  - Execution mode dropdown

---

### Custom RPC (per chain)

For advanced users, you can provide your own RPC endpoint for supported chains.

- Example: want to use your own Sui full node for fresh data? Plug it in.
- We **don’t store or share your RPC URLs** — they stay local to your browser.

> Great for privacy, rate limit control, or testing against private infra.

### Theme Settings

Customize the look of your IDE:

- **Light Mode**
- **Dark Mode**
- **Editor Theme**

Your theme preference is saved locally and applies instantly across the app.

### 🧪 Experimental Features

Sandworm includes a toggle for testing experimental features before they’re publicly released. These are still in flux, so expect bugs — but also cool stuff ahead.

Current & upcoming experiments include:

Multi-chain support

New visualization types

WQL extensions

AI-powered query suggestions (coming soon)

Whether you're writing raw WQL or just starting out, we’re designing Sandworm to scale across skill levels — from power users to curious explorers.

Turn it on if you’re feeling brave — or bored.

### 🛠️ More Coming Soon...

- Keyboard shortcut customizations
- Query autosave intervals
- Custom default views (e.g., always show results as chart)
