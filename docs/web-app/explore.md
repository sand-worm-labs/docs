# Explore

### What is Explore?

The **Explore** page is your gateway to the community’s queries. It’s where you can discover what others are working on, learn from their approaches, and reuse or remix public queries for your own use.

Think of it like a public library of onchain insights.

### What You Can Do in Explore:

#### Browse Public Queries

- Scroll through the list of saved queries created by other users.
- Use tags or filters (if available) to narrow down topics or protocols.

#### View a Query

- Click on any query to open and inspect:

  - The WQL syntax
  - Result view (table, chart, etc.)
  - Execution mode used (RPC or Indexed)
  - Author name and metadata

#### Fork a Query

- Hit **"Fork"** to clone the query into your own Workspace.
- You can edit, run, save, and export the forked version as your own.

#### View User Profiles

- Click on a user’s name or avatar to view their public profile.
- See all the queries they’ve shared — great for learning or finding power users.

> Tip: Forking a query is a great way to learn WQL syntax or kickstart a project using someone else’s structure.
