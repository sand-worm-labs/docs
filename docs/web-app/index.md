# Web App

## Overview

The Sandworm Web App is the main interface for querying and interacting with onchain data. It’s a fully-featured, browser-based IDE where you can write WQL queries, view results in real time, save and remix queries, explore datasets, and collaborate with the community.

You don’t need to set up any backend infra or configure RPC nodes. Just open your browser and start querying.

> For power users and devs who prefer the terminal, we also provide a **CLI version** of Sandworm with full WQL support — perfect for scripting, pipelines, or local workflows.

Whether you're building dashboards, analyzing trends, or tracking wallet activity — this is where it all starts.
