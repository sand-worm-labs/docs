# 10. FAQ & Troubleshooting

Here are answers to common questions and issues when using Sandworm.

---

### Why isn‚Äôt my query working?

If you run a query and get an error message, the **WQL compiler** will try to explain what went wrong. Common causes:

- **Typos or spelling mistakes** in table or field names
- **Using a table that doesn‚Äôt exist** (check the Dataset Explorer to confirm)
- **Incorrect syntax** (e.g., missing commas, unmatched parentheses)
- **Querying a chain or table that hasn‚Äôt been indexed yet**

Always double-check:

- The table and field names (case-sensitive)
- The chain you‚Äôre targeting
- Whether you're using **Indexed** or **RPC** execution

### I see ‚Äútable not found‚Äù or ‚Äúfield does not exist‚Äù

This usually means:

- You're querying a table or column that isn't available in the selected chain
- You may have selected the wrong execution mode

Fix:

- Open the **Dataset Explorer** in the side panel and browse available tables and fields for the chain you're working on
- Make sure your query is aligned with what's actually available in **that** chain's schema

### What‚Äôs the difference between RPC and Indexed mode?

- **RPC Mode** runs queries directly on the live chain using your (or our default) RPC endpoint.
- **Indexed Mode** runs queries on pre-processed, faster data stored in our backend.

Use **Indexed** for better performance and historical queries.
Use **RPC** if you want the most up-to-date, real-time data.

### My results show up, but I can‚Äôt see a chart?

Not all queries can be visualized as charts ‚Äî you need structured numeric or time-series data.

Common reasons charts don‚Äôt render:

- The result is missing a proper **X and Y axis**
- There‚Äôs no numeric value to graph
- Too many nested or ungrouped results

üîß Tip:
You can **manually select fields for X and Y axes** in the Chart view using the dropdown menus. Try simplifying your query first.

### Where are my saved queries?

Saved queries live in your **Dashboard**.
From there you can:

- View and re-run them
- Edit or delete them
- Export results again

---

### What happens to my custom RPC?

If you set a custom RPC in **Workspace Settings**, it stays **local to your browser**.
We **don‚Äôt store or transmit** your RPC keys ‚Äî they‚Äôre saved in your local storage only.
