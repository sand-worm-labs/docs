## 🌍 Built for the Community, By the Community

Sandworm was never meant to be owned or controlled by a single team. We started it but we don’t gatekeep it.

Our vision is to build **an open, decentralized foundation for onchain intelligence**, and that includes:

- A **community-led consensus system** to shape what gets built
- A **fair contribution model** where the most active users and contributors help steer the direction
- A roadmap to eventually take Sandworm **fully onchain**

Anyone can contribute. And over time, contributors will have more say in how Sandworm evolves — from features to data priorities to governance.

> We're not just building tools. We’re building infrastructure for everyone.  
> If that resonates with you — welcome. Let’s build it together.
