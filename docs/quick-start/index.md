# Quick Start

Welcome to Sandworm, your onchain data IDE. This Quick Start guide will take you from 0 to querying in minutes.

---

### Step 1: Open the Web App

Head to **[sandwormlabs.xyz](https://www.sandwormlabs.xyz/)** and land on the homepage.

From here, you can:

- Click **“Explore”** to view public queries from other users
- Or head straight to **“Workspace”** to start building your own

---

### Step 2: Start a New Query

In the **Workspace**, you have two options:

- **New Blank Editor** — start from scratch with your own WQL query
- **Template** — pick from a list of pre-built queries to edit and explore

For this guide, we’ll:

1. Select the **first template query**
2. Click **"Open in New Tab"** to launch it in a separate workspace window

This lets you explore the structure of a working query before writing your own.

---

### Step 3: Write & Run Queries

Write your query using **WQL (Worm Query Language)** — it's like SQL, but made for blockchain.

Choose between two execution modes:

- 🟢 **RPC (Live Mode)** — pulls data directly from the chain in real-time
- ⚡ **Indexed Mode** — pulls from our indexed datasets for faster response

Click **Run** to execute.

---

### Step 4: View & Explore Results

Your query results will appear instantly. You can switch views depending on your needs:

- **Table (default)** – raw structured output
- **Chart** – visualize with bar, line, or pie graphs
- **JSON** – view structured data
- **Counter** – for single-number metrics

---

### Step 5: Save, Export, and Share

Once you're happy with your query:

- **Save** it to your personal dashboard
- **Export results** as CSV, PDF, Parquet, or raw JSON
- **Share** the query using a public link
- **Fork** someone else’s query from Explore and make it your own

That’s it! You’re worming 🪱
