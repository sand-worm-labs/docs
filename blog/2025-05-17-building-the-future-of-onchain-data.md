## **Query Everything: Why We Built Sandworm**

### From idea to MVP

Blockchain data is public, in theory.
In practice? It’s quite difficult to get specific data. You’re piecing together data from five different platforms, some with rate limits, some with missing endpoints. and worse if you’re looking for something specific, like transactions from that niche contract your app depends on.

We’ve been there. You just wanna know _who swapped what_, and suddenly you’re 20 tabs deep in explorer hell, mentally diffing JSON payloads.

We wanted to query chain data like devs query SQL databases: intuitively, efficiently, and without asking for permission.

So we built the tool we wish we had.

### What Sandworm Is (and Isn’t)

Sandworm is for the curious ones.
The devs, the researchers, the data nerds who don’t just read the chain. They interrogate it.

It’s:

- A live IDE for querying blockchain data
- Powered by WQL (a SQL-style query language)
- Built with gists, visual previews, and public sharing
- Open by default — no login wall, no hidden API keys
- Designed for fast iteration, public knowledge, and eventually — full decentralization

It’s not another analytics dashboard. It’s a raw interface for onchain intelligence. Built for power users and the onchain curious alike.

### Our Vision: Data for the People

At first glance, Sandworm might feel like just another dev tool. But under the hood, it’s something else entirely:

> Sandworm is built for the community.

No middlemen. No gatekeeping. Just raw, explorable, onchain data, the way it should be. We’re building a transparent, accessible, and _composable_ data layer. Something anyone can tap into, remix, and build on top of.

Sandworm isn’t controlled by a central team.
Yes, we kickstarted it. But we don’t **own** it.

The future?

- A **community-driven consensus model**, where features, support, and standards evolve based on user needs
- A **fair contribution system**, where builders, writers, and query wizards get real ownership
- A **fully onchain backend**, where access rules and query execution live transparently on the chain

> This isn’t just another tool for reading the chain.
> It’s the beginning of decentralized intelligence — a shared layer for understanding what’s actually happening onchain.

We’re not just opening the data.
We’re opening the protocol.

### What's Live Right Now

- WQL: simple, expressive, and powerful
- A clean, fast IDE with tabs, previews, and gist saving
- Public query explorer (no sign-up needed)
- Fork + remix queries like a dev sandbox
- Real-time querying on Sui, Eth, Base and EVM chains (more chains soon)

---

### What’s Coming Next

We’re shipping fast. Here’s what’s on deck:

- Visual dashboards + Custom data visualisation
- Multichain support
- Plugins + integrations
- Community roadmap voting
- AI layer for querying, analysis, and accessibility
- Contributor incentives + protocol ownership
- Fully onchain infra for trustless data access + governance

### Try It. Fork It. Break It.

Sandworm is now in private beta, raw but ready. Access is limited to folks we share the link and Discord with, keeping things tight while we fine-tune. No sign-up walls for our testers. Just vibes, queries, and chaos.

→ Fork a gist
→ Build your own
→ Remix what others have made
→ Or just lurk and learn. That’s valid too.

This is yours now.
Use it how you want. Break it if you must.

We’ll be here — listening, shipping, and making it better with you.

### 8. TL;DR? We’re Not Here to Play.

Sandworm isn’t just a tool. It’s a turning point.

If you crave deeper insight not just access, you’re in the right place.
We’re building for the ones who question everything and want to build in the open.

Query everything.
Fork the system.
And let’s build the future of onchain data — together.
